The [Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre](http://computingeducationresearch.org), together with [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk), have established a partnership that brings together teachers who are interested in participating in classroom-based research projects.

Many teachers are already conducting small 'action research' projects as part of their school research interests; others might like to but their school is not actively involved in action research, and so you are not sure where to start. Whichever of these camps you are in, we felt it would be good to provide some structure and support around the process. 

Classroom-based research is an excellent form of professional learning as it is directly linked to issues in the classroom and the real-world context. The findings that you might have from an investigation can add to your understanding of your own teaching and what might work in other schools. 

The world of research literature, data collection and analysis and writing up projects can seem daunting, so partnering academics who have experience in these areas with teachers who have genuine problems to solve, is a productive way forward.

## Objectives

- To support teachers wishing to conduct classroom-based research projects in their schools
- To provide teachers interested in classroom-based research with a peer network of support
- To facilitate collaboration between universities and schools for the scoping and planning of future research projects

October 
Online informational webinar for those interested
November
Hybrid (F2F in Cambridge) meeting for teachers to plan research projects. This is likely to be a twilight meeting to facilitate local teachers attending.
December - April
Regular support sessions giving advice/support as teachers conduct classroom-based action research projects
May 
2nd Hybrid meeting (F2F in Cambridge) to bring along data, data analysis ideas, to discuss. This may need to be multiple meetings to give sufficient support.
June
Plan how to present findings - online webinar
