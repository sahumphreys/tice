<div class="abstract">
Your write-up/report will serve as the documentation of the project's objectives, methods, findings, and reflections. It validates the credibility of the research and enables other educators to share valuable insights, promote evidence-based practices, and contribute to continuous improvement within your community.

Throughout this course we have emphasised that it is the process you have gone through which will bring the most benefit and change to your own teaching practice and pedagogical content knowledge.  This is, indeed, invaluable.  However, others in your situation can also benefit from the 'pain' you have gone through during this year.

By writing up your project you can:

- share your experience with other teachers who may want to do something similar;
- share within your own school more easily;
- acknowledge the project has ended.

Also, it gives you a sense of achievement.

For our purposes, we would like to gather together all of the reports into a published document and make this publicly available through both the Computing At School community and the wider research community via RPCERC.

## Tips for Writing

- **Your audience**: imagine you are writing for another teacher in another school
- **Writing style**: don’t worry about being 'academic' - it’s a short report, so keep it simple
- **Images**: tables, graphs and example quotes in call out boxes would be good to break up the text, if you have any.
- **Anonymity**: don’t include photos of pupils unless you have anonymised them (e.g. opaque box over eyes) and don’t mention pupils or other teachers' real names
- **Drafts**: We are are happy to review drafts, as will be your helper.
