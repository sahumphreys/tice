## What is action research?

**Action Research** is also known as **practictioner research**, a research-oriented activity designed to improve current practice.  The canonic definition in the educational context is provided by Carr and Kemmis (1986):

> Action research is simply a form of self-reflective enquiry undertaken by participants in social situations in order to improve the rationality and justice of their own practices, their understanding of these practices, and the situations in which the practices are carried out (Carr and Kemmis 1986: 162)

Or generally:

> the study of a social situation with a view to improving the quality of action within it (Elliot, 1991) [^1]

It starts with a particular interest in a problem, a sense that something could be approached differently to achieve a better outcome.  In the context of the classroom, this could be a teaching strategy such as assessment and the feedback we give our pupils to improve attainment. Or a topic, such as the threshold concept of variables.  Or a wider issue, such as girls not choosing to opt for Computer Science at Key Stage 3.  

The appeal of action research is that it is firmly located in **your** classroom and **your** approach ot teaching **your** students.  It enables you to reflect on your own practice.  To home in one an aspect of your teaching that you would like to improve.  Consequently, it is excellent CPD.

Of course, it may not be focused on a problem area but merely something you want to try out or think about.

Whilst the research is undertaken with your students in your classroom the benefit of your research can have far-reaching implications and contribute to the body of practice in other departments in your schools as well as nationally and even internationally.  Carrying out action research as part of Computing At School and the Centre for Educational Research in Computing provides just the opportunity.

## Stages involved in action research

Action research consists of a number of stages:

- Identify the problem to be studied
- Collect initial data
- Organise, analyse and interpret the data
- Develop an intervention or activity to address the problem
- Implement the activity
- Collect post-activity data
- Evaluate the results of the intervention
- And ... repeat!

Strictly speaking this is a cyclic, or spiral, endeavour and ideally collaborative in that involves other members of your department or faculty but can also be with other teachers in other schools.
