# Welcome to Teacher Inquiry into Computing Education (TICE)

The Teacher Inquiry in Computing Education (TICE) project supports computing teachers in conducting [action research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_research) projects within their schools as part of their classroom activity.

- Action research, involving experimentation and reflection on teaching practice, is a powerful form of professional development. 
- It empowers teachers, providing autonomy over their learning, unlike traditional CPD models that follow a delivery approach.

This project is generously supported by [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk) and the [Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre](https://computingeducationresearch.org) provides an ideal opportunity for teachers of all phases of education to improve their teaching practice and their understanding of the subject.
